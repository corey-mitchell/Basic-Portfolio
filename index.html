            <p class="about-text">I am a musician at heart!  Music's slow transition to digital over analog led me to start making music through a digital interface and learning the intricacies of sound manipulation.  At some point, however, I realized some limitations within the interface and became curious on how I could push those limitations.  I then quickly discovered that in order to push any limits in a direction that I found desirable, I would have to learn how the program functioned and that is what brought me into the field of computer programming.</p>
            <p class="about-text">	I have not been programming long, but the tediousness and constant troubleshooting actually feels much like creating music through a digital interface.  In a way, it feels familiar. As my instructor once said, "Art is hours of my time compressed into minutes for you".  This feeling is what made me want to purse programming as a career, a rewarding and creative outlet that is actually lucrative.</p>
            <p class="about-text">My ambition with web-development is to have a personal skill that I can apply in a professional and recreational environment, to further my career and my hobbies!</p>
